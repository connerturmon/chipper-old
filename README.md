# Chipper - A Chip-8 Emulator in C

Chipper is a Chip-8 Emulator written in C with the SDL2 framework for
audio, video, and input. This emulator is the first of hopefully many emulator
projects, mostly aimed at providing an educational learning experience in
low level hardware emulation.

This emulator is not expected to be fully fleshed out, as I fairly new to software
development and computer engineering. I do hope, however, that with time I am
able to improve on this emulator and many more in the future.
